		<h2>Welcome to Ferenbrooke</h2>
		<p>Ferenbrooke is a medium-sized town somewhere in the East of England, not far from the East Midlands. It has a vaguely defined population and location, and is home to many notable anomalies and regrettable discoveries. A university town, it attracts a wide variety of students from all the world's dark places. The natives live in fear of the next time the graduate students in the physics department get a little excitable.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In another context, Ferenbrooke is a setting in which I place most of my horror stories. It's part Cambridge (my home town), part Arkham (of Lovecraft Mythos fame). If you like horror with a little occult strangeness and a dash of sci-fi, you might enjoy my work. Most of it is here, free for anyone who wants it.</p>
		<p>Happy reading.</p>

		    <p class="conBlurb">The event was larger than I’d anticipated. Close to a hundred people filled the small University hall, half a dozen or so waitstaff tending to the crowd. Across the other end of the room I saw Chelsea getting balls deep into yet another white wine spritzer. Old stone walls lent the whole affair a grandiose atmosphere and spine-breaking acoustics. Every word became a warcry, every whisper a scream. The main man, Doctor Sullivan Griever himself, occasionally appeared from a dark corner and...</p>
