                    I stood in front of my friend’s house alone. He’d handed over the
                    keys as though they were nothing more than twisted shapes in cheap
                    alloy, as though the act of supplying me with shelter was as simple
                    as lifting a cup to your lips. Perhaps the act truly was so trivial
                    to him; Ali was many things, destitute was not among them. In fact,
                    of those various wayward souls that had composed our little circle
                    in secondary school, Ali stood out as the Rich Kid. I...

                    ‘That’s the last of them,’ Mark said as he placed yet another
                    cardboard box on the kitchen table. His face shone with sweat and
                    joy, a broad smile parting his moustache from his beard. Ivy paused
                    her self-assigned task of filling the built-in kitchen cupboards
                    with crockery and glassware and glanced at him, smiled. The last few
                    weeks had been a blur. They’d put the offer in, squared it with the
                    bank, gone through the bureaucratic purgatory of...

                    With helmet in one hand and overladen saddle bags in the other,
                    Ethan charged out into the bitter autumn evening from number 43 and
                    let the door slam behind him. He glanced back at the building, once
                    a large house for an expansive family and now three mediocre flats.
                    One of them, until just that moment, had housed him and Erin. He
                    wiped the wet from his eyes and stepped quickly to the road. His
                    bike, an obedient if underpowered Royal Enfield Bullet 500,
                    waited...

                    The event was larger than I’d anticipated. Close to a hundred people
                    filled the small University hall, half a dozen or so waitstaff
                    tending to the crowd. Across the other end of the room I saw Chelsea
                    getting balls deep into yet another white wine spritzer. Old stone
                    walls lent the whole affair a grandiose atmosphere and
                    spine-breaking acoustics. Every word became a warcry, every whisper
                    a scream. The main man, Doctor Sullivan Griever himself,
                    occasionally appeared from a dark corner and...

                    Lucy Hayward placed her mug down on her kitchen table, furrowed her
                    brow, and said, ‘You’re actually gonna do it?’ Chris O’Halloran, a
                    good-natured Canadian from the flat across the hallway, shrugged and
                    said, ‘Yeah, why not? He’s paying.’ He was sitting on the other end
                    of her sofa, sipping water, doing the neighbourly thing and giving
                    her the lay of the land. Lucy shuddered. ‘Albert’s creepy as fuck,’
                    she said...
