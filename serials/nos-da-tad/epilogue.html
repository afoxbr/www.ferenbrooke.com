        <h2>Nos Da, Tad</h2>
        <h3>Epilogue</h3>
        <article class="storyText">
          <p>
            May curses and growls as she scrubs scarlet hair dye from the
            downstairs sink in Owen’s unwanted house. She’d volunteered to stay
            in Ferenbrooke to arrange selling the house, though that was proving
            to be harder than she’d thought. Every estate agent that had looked
            at the house had met with some sort of accident within a few days,
            prospective buyers would invariably meet some circumstance that
            prevented a viewing. It was as though the house didn’t want to be
            sold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curiously, May felt relieved by this, in a way. Something about
            staying in this town made her feel…not more alive, but certainly
            more awake, more focused. She’d been reading a blog called
            <em>Freaky Ferenbrooke</em> which she discovered while researching
            more into the weirdness of the town. Though it’s impossible to say
            how much of the blog’s content was accurate, and of that how much
            involved the secret society that Owen’s father had been a member of,
            May can’t put it down. There’s <em>something</em> bigger going on,
            and she wants to know more.
          </p>
          <p>Her phone buzzes. Owen.</p>
          <p>‘Hey, how are things? Still slipping into Welsh?’</p>
          <p>
            ‘Weithiau,’ Owen says, chuckling. ‘Not too bad, though. Any bites on
            the house?’
          </p>
          <p>‘Nothing concrete, unfortunately.’</p>
          <p>
            ‘Do you think maybe you should take a break? Get out of that town? I
            don’t like the thought of you being there without anyone you know.’’
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Actually,’ May takes a breath. She’s been thinking about this for a
            couple of weeks now, it’s time to raise it. ‘This feels like exactly
            where I’m supposed to be. I was wondering actually, since this place
            is proving impossible to shift, maybe you’d consider renting it to
            me? I’m between places anyway, and between jobs for that matter.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Owen pauses. Slowly, he says, ‘If you’re sure that’s what you want.
            But you don’t have to worry about paying rent. Not like there’s a
            mortgage to pay or anything.’
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No, I’ll pay you. Uh…just give me a chance to find a job, first.’
          </p>
          <p>‘Okay, no problem. I guess we’ll take it off the market, then.’</p>
          <p>‘Thanks, Owen. I’ll take care of the place.’</p>
          <p>‘I really don’t give a shit if it burns to the ground.’</p>
          <p>
            May grunts, nodding to herself. Of course Owen feels that way,
            that’s perfectly natural. In fact, it’s a little strange that he
            isn’t raising more of a fuss.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Do me a favour though,’ Owen says, ‘and let me know if you come
            across anything strange. Don’t get yourself in trouble, call me if
            things get…’
          </p>
          <p>
            May cuts him off. ‘Yeah, yeah, any cults or experiments or anything
            like that and I’ll be on the first train back to sanity. Don’t
            worry. I’m a big girl, I can take care of myself.’
          </p>
          <p>‘I know. I love you.’</p>
          <p>‘Love you too. Speak tomorrow?’</p>
          <p>‘Yeah, call me after six.’</p>
          <p>
            May hangs up and stares at her phone for a moment. She rifles
            through her mental Rolodex of acquaintances back home. She can’t
            think of anyone that would miss her greatly, anyone who would need a
            goodbye call.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that’s that. She lives in Ferenbrooke now. With a secret society
            of black magicians on the loose.
          </p>
          <p>
            She pulls up the blog she’d found earlier, thumbs her way to the
            contacts page. Perhaps this person could tell her more about the
            Society. Perhaps she’d like to know a little about what May, Owen,
            and Martin had experienced in that doctor’s office.
