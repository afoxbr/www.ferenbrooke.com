        <h1>End of Year Musings '24'</h1>
        <article class="storyText">
          <p>29/12/2024</p>
          <p>
            It’s been a hell of a year in the F. household. I started 2024
            unable to walk and uncertain that I ever would again due to the hit
            and run that I <em>never shut up about</em>. We had a one-year-old,
            my wife had not returned to work, and my job as a wax factory worker
            was looking untenable. I’d eventually get back on my feet with
            crutches in January, a walking stick in April, and unaided in June
            (except for the bad days). I returned to work in June, as well.
            Though I am currently off again since September due to mental health
            issues (the accident dramatically worsened my existing C-PTSD), I am
            certainly doing a lot better this year.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the big ticks in the plus column for EOY ’24 over ’23 is the
            fact that I’m writing again. I’d more or less stopped horror related
            activities after Jacob was born, unable to handle the combined
            stress of hard, physical shift work plus fatherhood plus my somewhat
            unhinged writing process. Returning has meant a lot to me. I think
            it took getting close enough to death to tickle the Grim Reaper’s
            taint for me to realise just how important my silly little stories
            are to me, even if nobody is reading them. In fact, processing the
            accident by writing horror and weird fiction inspired by it is one
            of the first and most frequent things I thought about while I was in
            the hospital, aside from thoughts of my wife and son.
          </p>
          <p>
            So yeah, I’m back in the game with this new website. It looks very
            retro and amateurish, which is exactly the look I’m going for
            (honest!). I want it to feel very human and raw, which is also how I
            want my stories to feel. I want it to nod vaguely in the direction
            of the web idealism of the late ’90s and early 2000s rather than
            seamlessly blending in with the corporate web apps of 2024. A bit of
            a throwback. More Neocities than Squarespace (though I’m not using
            Neocities since I decided to spin up and manage an OpenBSD server
            myself. It’s going for that same vibe, though).
          </p>
          <p>But I digress.</p>
          <p>
            What I want to do tonight is write a little about what I’m planning
            for Ferenbrooke in the coming year. I’ll follow that up with a few
            paragraphs on what I’m happy about, and things I’m thankful for. It
            feels like a good and proper thing to do at the end of the year, and
            I’m sure my therapist would approve.
          </p>

            Firstly, I’ll be ending <em>Nos Da, Tad</em> with a new epilogue.
            This’ll set up a couple of things which I’ll be writing later in the
            year. That’s all I’ll say for now, but I think a couple of readers
            of the original version of <em>Nos Da, Tad</em> will be quite
            pleased if I’m remembering their comments correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve started loosely sketching out some ideas for the next serial,
            which I want to start posting in the Spring. It’s going to focus on
            a down-and-out bartender coming across an alternative internet
            protocol and slowly uncovering a mystery around the creator of said
            protocol. It’s inspired by Gopher and Gemini (not the Google thing,
            the <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/">Gemini protocol</a>) and
            the phenomenon of paranoia and conspiracy culture. I’m still
            workshopping a name, but I’m looking forward to getting right into
            the story. As a way of celebrating this story, I’ll also be spinning
            up servers in Gopherspace and Geminispace and mirroring
            ferenbrooke.com there. I’m a big fan of these smaller, simpler
            protocols due to my old-man-esque feeling that the modern web is
            just too damn complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the short story front, I’ve got a few recurring characters to
            introduce. One of them, a detective named Amy Russell, is also the
            protagonist of a novel I’m intermittently working on, so I’m quite
            keen to introduce her to the world outside my head. Another is Lucia
            Ivanova, the savvy mind behind the blog
            <em>Freaky Ferenbrooke</em> (mentioned in <em>The Rail House</em>).
            It’s likely the blog will come up again before she makes an
            appearance, but I do want to get her on the page soonish. Ethan,
            from <em>Cat’s Eyes</em>, might get another story. He sort of came
            out of nowhere. I wrote that story based on a recurring dream I’ve
            been having, so I was quite surprised to find myself getting such a
            strong sense of who Ethan is as a character quite quickly and I’m
            keen to see what happens if I throw some more strangeness his way.
          </p>
          <p>
            My overall goal for Ferenbrooke is to have the stories largely work
            fine on their own, but also provide something extra for those who
            read more widely on the site. I’m trying to ensure that I don’t
            accidentally write one giant mosaic novel where the stories don’t
            individually work well without the larger context while also adding
            enough Easter eggs, references, and a sense of a larger narrative to
            make it rewarding to read the whole lot. It’s a nontrivial target,
            but hopefully I’ll hit it.

            Ending The Year With Gratitude
          </h2>
          <p>Dr. Andrews, this bit is for you.</p>
          <p>
            I’m glad my son is getting a little older, a little smarter, and
            developing a strong personality. I’m glad my wife is enjoying being
            back at work and I am glad she gets to have her endometriosis
            surgery soon to improve her quality of life. I’m glad my family is
            safe and happy. I’m glad I can walk.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m glad I managed to get this site up. I’m glad that I’ve written
            every line of HTML, CSS, and XML myself rather than generating it
            (well, more or less. The prose is written in markdown then I convert
            it to HTML and wrap it in a template I made). That might change as
            this site grows, but the ’90s style web dev experience is serving as
            a sort of mindfulness exercise right now. I’m glad I’m writing
            again, and glad that a few people are reading it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m thankful for my wife and son, for their love and support, and
            for the continued understanding of my employer. I’m thankful, too,
            for the folks that have taken time out of their day to read the
            stuff I’m putting on this site. I’m thankful for my friends in the
            horror community and for all the cool indie authors and small
            presses that produced a tonne of new books for me to read now that
            I’m immersing myself in this little corner of the lit world again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m thankful for the people that heard the crash at 4:45am on
            23/11/2023 and left their houses to see what happened. I’m thankful
            that they spotted my twisted, broken body in the ditch ten metres
            from my motorbike and called emergency services. I’m thankful for
            the air ambulance that pumped 5 units of blood into me to stave of
            haemorrhagic shock. I’m thankful for all the doctors, nursing staff,
            and other NHS workers that put me back together over the course of a
            month and five surgeries. I’m thankful for the synthetic bone graft
            in my left knee and for the 34 titanium implants in my left leg,
            pelvis, back, and right arm. I’m thankful for the fellow patients I
            met in hospital who made me feel a little more human while I was
            wired up to a bunch of machines and had a bunch of tubes going in
            and out of me. I’m <em>double</em> thankful for the silly amount of
            morphine I was on the whole time I was in the hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            And finally, I’m thankful for my scars. The ones you can see and the
            ones you can’t. I might not like them, but they make me who I am,
            and that’s worth something.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
