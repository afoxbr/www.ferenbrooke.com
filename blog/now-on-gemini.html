        <h1>Ferenbrooke is Now on The Gemini Protocol!</h1>
        <article class="storyText">
          <p>22/06/2025</p>
<p>After much procrastination and some actual genuine time-sinks (like moving back to Cambridgeshire from Essex), I finally got around to launching a Gemini capsule and formatting the content of this site for it. I’m very new to Gemini, so please don’t hesitate to email me at ferenbrooke@mailbox.org (new email address BTW) if you spot anything funky.</p>
<p>For those not acquainted with Gemini, think Gopher but tweaked for the 21st century. Very simple, no scripting or styling, but still fundamentally a way of browsing the internet. It’s different browsers and different (text-only) sites, but it isn’t all that alien. I like it quite a bit.</p>
<p>Everything from here on out will be posted on both the website and the capsule, ideally at the same time but we’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>With any luck, there’ll be a new story up by the end of the month. I’ve somehow contracted this bizarre affliction wherein every time I try to write a short, it decides it wants to be a novel. Think I might have just about beaten it, but the result of this is that I have three partially written novels knocking about in addition to the beginnings of a serial. I’m going to try and get out another three or so shorts before I start posting the serial and I want all that to be well underway before the end of the summer, so I need to get into gear.</p>
<p>But I digress. I got the capsule up, that’s a tick off the ol’ todo list, so I’m going to log off and pat myself on the back for a minute before I return my nose to its rightful place on the grindstone.</p>
<p>Toodles,</p>
