                <p class="conBlurb">
                    After much procrastination and some actual genuine time-sinks (like moving back to Cambridgeshire from Essex), I finally got around to launching a Gemini capsule and formatting the content of this site for it. I’m very new to Gemini, so please don’t hesitate to email me at ferenbrooke@mailbox.org (new email address BTW) if you spot anything funky. For those not acquainted with Gemini, think Gopher but tweaked for the 21st century. Very simple, no scripting or...

                    It’s been a hell of a year in the F. household. I started 2024
                    unable to walk and uncertain that I ever would again due to the hit
                    and run that I <em>never shut up about</em>. We had a one-year-old,
                    my wife had not returned to work, and my job as a wax factory worker
                    was looking untenable. I’d eventually get back on my feet with
                    crutches in January, a walking stick in April, and unaided in

                    It’s been a long time since I’ve written creatively. I’ve done a few
                    blog posts about tech and politics on my other blog, but I haven’t
                    made stories in quite a while. I’ve...
